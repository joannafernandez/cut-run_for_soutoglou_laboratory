# Running CNR on ARTEMIS ✂️🏃🏹

Here are the commands in an example walk through with our lab data to run the nf-core cut&RUN pipeline on Artemis

1️⃣ Create work directory
let's make a nested directory
```bash
mkdir -p ~/IVR2_test
```

> until I figure out how to upload and download data from command line for Artemis, we're gonna do things a little clunkily

2️⃣ Log onto OOD and upload your files to your new directory

First, the necessary fastq.gz files 

*important* always keep them in .gz, this is the necessary input format for the nf-core pipeline

We can verify upload either through the online interface or in the terminal

3️⃣ Let's prepare our sample sheet with the correct file paths

double check the working directory
```bash
pwd #print working directory
```
```bash
out: /mnt/nfs2/gdsc/jf383/IVR2_test
```
#### Information on how to format the sample sheet is here:
> remeber to upload this also to a directory you can call in the pipeline
